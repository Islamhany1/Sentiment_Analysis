tequila rum triple sec and make with freshly squeeze orange juice triple sec be an orange flavor liqueur make from the dry peel of bitter sweet orange and with the use of fresh orange juice the

make with fresh kiwi mint the flavor of fresh ingredient be significant make the drink so refreshing usually in bar they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredient which make their drink really nice after that I try their chicken taco those taco be make for indians so you can t get the blunt taste but the real fusion work here those taco be stuff with indian spiced grill chicken and top with mint raita and serve in malabar ghee fry parota taste wise they be so good but the only thing which bother I the malabar parota as the parota have layer so it be difficult to hold the entire

time for the cocktail which be literally invite I to taste it and believe I it be kick off so strong but nice orange flavor very refreshing I could only finish the th of the entire portion the stuff

what baharat spice be as per the chef the word baharat actually mean spice in arabic and not a single spice but a blend of several spice in this blend you can find black pepper coriander paprika cardamom nutmeg cumin clove and cinnamon so the chicken keema be cook with these spice though the sombousek look pretty similar with samosa but the taste be very different and that s why the different

dimly light with pretty lamp and decorative light now come to the food I feel the food be mostly good with only some exception we start with soup we have the arabian chicken soup and the lemon corriander soup the arabian chicken soup be a smooth and mild soup also it wasn t that thick too on the other hand the lemon corriander soup be real thick and be more spicy and have a freshness to it also it have baby corn carrot bean and such which make it even more well next we have starter chicken pahadi the pahadi kebab have all herb as flavour agent instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use the pahadi kabab they serve here be really good the flavouring be fresh and chicken be tender and easily come apart with a slight touch of the fork next we have paneer papdi kebab this be batter fried paneer slice the batter and it s season be good but inside the paneer should also have have some seasoning but the paneer be bland which spoil an otherwise great dish kung pao mushroom be okayish it taste almost like manchurian and lack the normal roasted peanut which you find generally in kung pao dish dragon chicken and hariyali fish tikka both be amazing I do recommend these golden fry prawn be good but they be batter fry which take away that prawn taste it be good but do not feel like have prawn golden fried baby corn be also good chilli paneer be disappoint the paneer be not soft and the dish just do work out lahori chicken kabab be also pretty good mushroom moti tikki be something I would avoid I do not like it but I feel this be a dish that one person might love

just pure awesomeness the piece be fry and then again toss with some sauce to give it a unique taste the fish mandi be also serve with a very tasty fried fish piece the fish be very flavourful and be

review it be an absolute delight to be at mazzo the view be something worth look forward to it s probably among the good view at a restaurant that you can get in hyderabad after a not so pleasant first encounter I decide to give it another attempt and boy this time it be definitely worth we be welcome warmly and the chef greet we and carefully note our preference in food and taste soon after we be serve with fried papad to nibble on and cranberry base mocktail to give some company the poolside table with that view be sure to make your evening a little later the hot and sour soup arrive it be a tad bit spicy but it sure open up all the taste sense to enjoy the dish come in later for starter we have veg manchurian and paneer serve with the green chutney dip the veg manchurian be a little more spicy but taste good anyway and the paneer be absolute perfection with the soft paneer cook in real balanced masala we then get in veg lasagne and veg biryani for main course the lasagne be cook very differently from the one that I have early this have a very different taste I m not compare in term of well or bad just a very different taste and it be a delight not just to the taste bud but also to the eye wink the biryani as usual be good accompany with this be the apple mint mojito which leave a tingle sweet taste every time I have a sip the good be save for the last although we be full to the brim I couldn t leave the beautiful rasmalai untouche and of course there s always a separate stomach for dessert so overall I have a lovely evening with my sister that day and I recommend it for date or business dinner maybe even hangout with a friend or two you d have a sublime time regardless of who you re with old review overall rating such a serene ambience if only it be accompany by some good food I and my sister drop by this place one evening I be strike with the beautiful view this place have at night we ask for the menu a couple time after which we finally get it the menu have limit option and if you be look for vegetarian item like I you hardly have a choice we order in a subz shammi kebab to start with the staff take their own sweet time to serve it but it be toothsome which compensate for the delay service I guess due to lack of option for drink we settle for a salt lassi and a hot chocolate I don t want to go into much depth but well they weren t great both the drink have thin consistency we then go ahead with the vegetable biryani it be definitely appetize along with the salan and the raita but the quantity be less I m not sure if the poor service be because it be late when we arrive or some other reason but to be perfectly candid I don t think I would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food definitely not worthy enough',

be good but not live up to the expectation we be ask if we be here for buffet the restaurant it seem be more concentrated on buffet I have a look at the menu and it didn t interest I the manager at this place be a nice fellow who carefully take our order of dragon chicken punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan after a fair bit of waiting time we re serve with dragon chicken I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry so that the flavour stick to the chicken it be a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spare for presentation the server need to be teach a little bit about serve they be fumble and also be handle hot utensil without use tissue paper then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan simply put it be a disaster the curry be as bland as it

you have such a title you should at least try to make it work for you the restaurant be confused whether it should cater to immigrant north indian population or the traditional south indian population one thing that scream out their confusion about the above be their buffet menu they try to make it a fusion and have end it make a confusion have the restaurant be a traditional southern one I would

seating arrangement owe to the summer we opt for indoor seating the table be well space and there s enough distance between the adjacent table to give you a premium experience the server be well groom attentive and make good recommendation basis the speciality of the restaurant and after check your preference for starter we order lotus stem galouti kebab and nachos the kebab be well cooked and though a little spicy leave a good after taste the nachos be light crispy and have good amount of topping despite nachos be one of the common starter I d still recommend people to try the one here for the main course we order the lahori paneer combo that get serve with a small bowl of dal makhni and naan pulao the paneer too taste very good and have the right amount of spice which blend well with the paneer the dal makhni that come along with the paneer be out of this world it s a pity that it doesn t get serve separately but upon request the server certainly oblige by offer another small bowl of the same for something that s prepare so well I feel that the patron should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu finally the dessert tiramisu pastry simply no word right amount of sweetness well blend flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee after a good dinner the tiramisu seal the deal for we to be one completely satisfied customer one small observation that I d still like to add be that despite a good number of server they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the table start get full towards the end we have to remind they about the dessert and it be evident that they have miss bring it however consider that they be attentive and friendly for most of our time there I wouldn t

well light the indoor seating be more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized group come to the food it be really mind blow we try a bunch of item and majority of they taste great let have a look at the item we try start from mocktail to appetizer and main course and end it with dessert firstly we have tandoori malai broccoli which literally surprise I who have think broccoli could be that tasty it taste amazing with a creamy taste to it next we have crispy chapa which be basically crispy crump coat fried fish with curry leave seasoning which give it a unique flavour this be an outstanding dish and all of we love it morrocan chicken stick be our next item and this one be also pretty good the chicken be slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasoning on top the chicken be nice tender and juicy too I love seafood and so I end up order a jhinga nasheela this taste good but nothing extraordinary about it it be just good that s it we also have chicken nachos which be serve in a big bowl with lot of cheese and salsa and the right seasoning love it we also have a bruschetta which be average along with these we also order aalishaan chicken sandwich which I would say be not at all aalishaan this be not good it lack the right amount of chicken in it and be overall not tasty next we have a nawabi chicken pizza and it be really good the topping be great with lot of chicken and cheese and be true to its name but the down side of the pizza be its base the pizza base be really hard and dry which overall bring down the dish but I still have it because of the amazing topping we have a platter of fish finger and fry and it be excellent both the fish finger and the fry be good after devour all these starter we could only go for two main course dish and so we decide to go for the special h biriyani and spaghetti aglio e olio I be in love with their biriyani it be not like any other biriyani that I have ever taste before it be unique and it be excellent too it have a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in hyderabad and I could not guess what s the secret ingredient be the spaghetti I would say be decent but be definitely not among my favourite now come to the dessert we have vanilla ice cream and gulab jamuns I would say the dessert section do not provide for much choice the jamuna be decent we also have some moctail in between which be not up to the mark they need to improve their moctail the only one I feel be perfect be the virgin mojito other mocktail we have be not good we have some litchi base one and orange base one and also a pinacolada flavour one but we do not like these much overall I would say that the place offer really good food and the ambience be also great the drink

place be locate somewhere in financial district after you take a turn from the lemon tree hotel I pretty much have no clue about where I be exactly and the almost strand road be of not much help until you suddenly see the big light up sign with the word prism inscribe on it though conveniently cover by the bush around it another m or so you reach their parking yard and finally the enter the premise after it a huge velvety door open into this big sized cover arena for a lack of well word that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor the place have high table next to the dance area and then some couch on the far side there be a beautifully light up staircase that lead to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating and that be just one part of it they have an outdoor seating where the projector be put up for the match screening and double up as the smoking zone apart from this they have a pool which would be apt for a private gathering I be no club expert but their light system be sure one of their usp the dj play majorly bollywood that evening it be a wednesday and do a decent enough job while the place be all deck up pretty well the food on offer didn t impress I much starter burmese roll with sweet chilli dip a bit too oily they be okay to munch on they could have do with a bit more filling though punjabi paneer tikka with mint dip fail to impress the paneer be too rubbery in some place and in other too char the linger taste be merely of chilli and nothing else main prism special veggie lover pizza the dish that fare well with I it be thin crust and have a good amount of cheese for the price it may seem a bit costly but quite worth it as compare to other dish spaghetti their take of spaghetti aglio olio with mushroom and black olive topping this be also decent penne alfredo this be just regular nothing good or bad and this also go for the accompany garlic bread I didn t find the indian main anything great and need to be improve a lot the dessert be another downer chocolate truffle be all goey and just cream from the mocktail section I choose the safe bet go crazy it be a twist on the oreo shake with the inclusion of kitkat but it wasn t great either lack the comfort of a regular oreo shake if you be look for a party place that have a happen setup good crowd and amazing ambience this be your good bet but for the food it be well you stick with safe bet such as pizza and pasta they would give you the good value for money the alcohol be also a little pricey but you wouldn t mind that in a place like this', 'by invite the pub be locate in

the right balance of flavor and enhance by the sweet chilli dip the only issue be not that crispy and a bit more oily main for the main we have exotic vegetable in black pepper with rice the curry be just ok have a decent flavor but didn t have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it prism special veg pizza the thin crust pizza load with cheese and top with veggie like zucchini be the well main course that we have among the serve the pizza be decent in taste have not much of marinara base but be not bland either the pizza be although not crispy as we get busy catch up the trick perform by the bartender apart from these we be also serve veg pulao and meloni tarkari curry which be completely average and to be skip drink cucumber coriander mocktail the cucumber coriander mocktail be too sweet the flavor of cucumber have dominate the slight tinge of coriander go crazy the blend of oreo and chocolate be nothing out of the box and taste like a regular chocolate shake

can change lot of thing starter chicken lahsooni be good garlic taste be evident but overpower which be a good thing serve with mini papad roll and chutney burmese roll be something which I relish with corn and green chilie with some cheese stuff it get in my favorite list fish finger be too be decent enough pizza be good too both chicken and farm fresh pizza as topping be load but make sure you have it hot or warm as you like they certainly need to improve the pasta and paneer tikka all in all a great place for partying and event organise by prism management don t miss they at all monday

relatively outside the main city in financial district and have a huge area to offer one can enjoy poolside as well as at the sitting which be offer near the dance floor with big live screen and a great dj there be a lot of entertainment that you can expect out of the place start my food experience with their appetizer I try out their punjabi paneer tikka fish finger lehsooni murgh tikka and veg burmese roll the punjabi paneer tikka be good it have an exquisite flavor to it which be top notch serve along with onion salad and traditional mint chutney one can give this dish a shot next up their fish finger be quite normal for my palate they could improve the side dip and can use tartar dip as an option my favorite dish of the night be their lehsooni murgh tikka it have a really fantastic smoky flavor of garlic flake to it and be super tender the spice mix be really compliment the chicken and be a must try for you all veg burmese roll be a big disappointment for I it have some extra oil to it which could have be clearly avoid they need to work on the filling as well as the outer crust of the roll for their drink I try out their cosmopolitan margarita and passion all the drink be simply wonderful it be truly a great experience overall to have the right kind of drink at this place for main I have their exotic vegetable in black pepper sauce with rice farmer chicken pizza penne white sauce pasta exotic vegetable in black pepper sauce be good I usually don t like to have this at most outlet due to the overpower taste of the black pepper sauce but somehow these guy serve it very well alongside some rice their farmer chicken pizza be too good love the overall consistency of the dish a slight work need to be put up in their pasta I didn t find it much cheesy and tasty the place setup be quite big and they certainly have a good potential to improve on their food great place for partying for sure happy eating', 'such a pathetic experience I have in this place

what a beautiful preparation of spice and meat the meat in specific be cook very well and the spice be also within moderation I usually get scared with the spice level in such dish but aroma six get it absolutely right with this dish butter rotis even when they be deliver to we at home and as well in the office they be warm and soft nothing beat such a meal on an unusual cold hyderabad winter

their paneer biryani and it be fill to the core the quality of the rice and preparation be nice thank you for not be stingy with the paneer see if you can check for some good combo on popular food app

while we be have dinner they could have attend our request in the first go for the feel good quotient anyways let I quickly summarize the order we make there crabmeat soup this soup be thick with mince crab meat the broth be bland and you can customise it by infuse soy sauce vineager and crush pepper the whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste bud corn cube a must try out platter

consistency chicken yakitori I do not like this preparation it be very dull and tasteless there be six skewered chicken stick with capscicum and onion the chicken piece be succulent but do not imbue any flavor main course manchow chicken fry rice the rice be flavorful and spicy with lot of veggie and diced chicken piece in it it be a bit sticky and can be consume at its own dessert bangkok custurd I be assume that this dessert will be cold but it be just the opposite the custurd be hot and thick and make with coconut puree the thick sauce be decadent with load of nut it taste like firni as accompaniment there be thin crusty pineapple spring roll it be just yum for the greedy tongue total rs inclusive of taxis cobclusion the price range be moderate and the portion be generous in amount the food be delectable but do not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time the staff be inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the item put in the menu card no coordination among the staff either different staff will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple time or no one will attend the guest the dessert section in the menu card be quite attractive but most of the item be not available I have a discussion on this with the manager but rather than take it as a constructive feedback he delve himself into argument this be not the

an absolute delight to the minf soul and taste bud this I believe be the most innovative pan asian dish which I haven t have in a long time I call this an innovative dish because no other pan asian restaurant be able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything service I believe a restaurant can be surely judge by it s staff here the staff know all their dish so well that they be promptly able to suggest you with the right dish to compliment each other kudo to the staff ambiance as urban asia be a chain of restaurant we be make to sit at their indian counterpart

particularly compact serve only a selective few indian and oriental preparation both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diet sample their vegetarian appetizer from the a la carte section we end up call for their sizzling veg tikka platter and masala fry both of which turn out to be pretty good the platter come with different tikka of our choice namely veg shami peri peri and lemon pepper paneer tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onion on the base veg shami be something that be absolutely mindblowe with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture masala fry be just a indianize version of load fry with the crisp potato saute in with onion ginger and garlic which work as a good accompaniment for the drink non vegetarian section have some really nice dish include the tangri kebab lemon pepper fish tikka and honey chili chicken wing which be just perfect for a setting of this kind my personal favourite be their lemon pepper fish however for the juicy and succulent fish chunk give that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination honey chili wing too be pretty good as a finger food have crispy fry wing toss in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce probably the good candidate to be have along with a couple of chill beer disappointing be their chili fish however which have no flavour whatsoever bland piece of fish with the coating sauce contain just chili without any seasoning the kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in season the fried fish with some salt and pepper run a buffet on weekend the place offer a beautiful selection of main to the diner have a variety of indian option to choose from each of the diet have two curry on offer with a choice of bread and rice where the non vegetarian sect have chicken curry and murg makhani along with some delectable chicken tikka biryani after the disappointment in the starter it almost come as a surprise how good both the main be chicken curry have the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bite add go absolutely well with some hot tandoori rotis same be the case with murg makhani as well however it have a bit too much of sweetness for my taste try out their chicken tikka pizza from the a la carte section turn out to be a disaster as the puffy base seem to be store buy and stale which definitely didn t justify the price tag for the same the dessert option too give little to choose from where we go for the gajar ka halwa and rice kheer both of which be plain simple average the service too wasn t any exemplary as the staff almost at all time pay no heed to the diner call they out for help get even a glass of water turn out to be a huge task however on multiple complaint the restaurant manager do mend thing well the kitchen deserve appreciation for send out dish fast into the dining room however in the pace they almost always lack consistency the dish we order at the start of the meal when again call bring something entirely different and dreadful on a plate all in all if the place provide a run of the mill menu with a some good dish but lack the consistency to deliver entirely

only thing which upset I be that it be sweet than the normal version maybe they can work upon the use of cocunut cream in the curry for dessert I have their gajar ka halwa kheer and ice cream the

main course change the game completely the first taste of the spoonful of rice mix with the curry convert my brain into mush the explosion of flavour in my mouth be orgasmic I literally close my eye with that spoonful and they remain closed for the rest of the meal the raw mango slice the fresh fish the tangy tomato oh the side of blanched bean work so well to cleanse the palate between mouthful

offer we order soba noodle with pork and veggie naga pork curry which come with rice and then add some smoke fried pork with bamboo shoot the noodle be alright but have sort of a maggi consistency but there be enough pork to enhance the flavor the naga pork curry be a revelation spicy but so full of flavor my daughter who be averse to spice eat a fair bit the fry pork be delicious too but an overkill go by how we be already full with the first two dish we have order the flavored beer they have which be refreshing but relatively overpriced but just for the food I think we need to visit

be mildly unpleasant the starter be quite good spicy chicken momos and the pork preparation pork belly and some kind of chilly fry pork the main course however be disappointing or perhaps we expect something else the ramyum noodle taste like a bland version of top raman and the noodle have a strange texture to they there be not enough broth either which you tend to expect from any kind of raman noodle the teriyaki chicken rice be a tad too sweet for my palette personally the good thing would be the price everything be so resonably price it s not easy to find non veg especially pork beef etc at these price one major area of feedback would be the service they have an extremely laidback do not really care attitude and it take a bit of effort for we to get their attention and get they to the table each time a little more effort from the management and they could be do load well than they be currently maybe even start a franchise value for money service ambience overall', 'be here with

slow but the food be good if you re look for a bowl of north eastern style of raman try their version of it simple soupy and well spice it s a bowl of comfort let s not get your hope high just yet it s their version of it and not an attempt to mimic the classic raman that be usually popular otherwise the momos be good soft and melt in the mouth must try they run out of the vegetarian one rather

quantity of pork in the dish', 'my st visit to the place for lunch and I enjoy their food we order lemongrass chicken it be nice but not strong lemon grass flavor though but the chicken stew with rice be awesome it be very light yet very flavor full I will surely visit this place again to try their korean menu foodlove', 'having hear a lot of hype surround this place and the rating on zomato it be on my wishlist for age but I be always skeptical of the taste be too authentic and a totally new cuisine the former prove to be true and be the primary reason I didn t have a very pleasing dinner it s a small and cute little diner like cafe with minimalistic and soothing interior the sour smell of fermentation be nauseate initially but I get use to it in just a few minute some room freshener would do the trick the item be price very cheap I have high expectation but only to learn later the portion be just too small we have spicy drum of heaven the only thing I could properly finish a typical batter fry chicken almost south indian and spicy in taste but the coating be too thick chicken succulent yakitori skewer with tiny chicken chunk spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle texture be good but taste average sticky barbeque sauce coating it feel like chicken momos standard good amount of fill with a very pungent ginger flavor the coating be thick too chilli chutney serve alongside be not too spicy and go well with the momos bosam it be my first time try pork belly and I can t really judge but it feel fatty and gooey the piece be drench in grease serve with spicy kimchi which I love chicken ramyum noodle big bowl of noodle what look like maggi but be only a close resemblance scarce chicken piece undercooke dry and hard noodle and overall a very bland taste naga steam fish this be the thing cause the smell in the restaurant and I couldn t tolerate it a very very pungent and strong odor the fish have a great texture and be steam to perfection serve with steamed white rice whatever I mention about the food be just my impression and maybe because it be the first time try out this new cuisine I didn t really like it however one thing that be disappointing be the service it be slow and just take age once the food arrive it be fine but again the bill take more than minute as many other have already say I guess the strong point of this place be their pork preparation and I would recommend this place purely for that an elaborate menu with lot of option price well here s my overall score food not judge what I try first time don t know about ambience get a room freshen service vfm', 'I would give a negative star if possible for their hygiene and service we order our food at pm and after an hour s wait they come and say that what we order from the menu

optimistic that they will improve as they mature', 'I seriously didn t understand the buzz around this place decide to have sunday lunch here owe to the good rating of this place the staff didn t really give any attention and we have to find a table for ourselves many item on the menu be not available even on weekend and we settle for veg clear soup mushroom spinach soup to start with the quantity of soup be a bummer and it be a huge bowl quarter fill with soup if they plan to serve this quantity then they should switch to small bowl to atleast give illusion of a fill bowl mushroom spinach soup taste like maggi knorr soup and not fresh for starter we opt butter pepper garlic prawn it be serve in a small plate with even small portion tiny prawn for starter definitely doesn t justify the taste be average well than soup for main course we decide dotsol bibimbap and naga chicken curry main course be way well in taste and we really like bibimbap naga chicken be good in taste

they use feel like instant noddle and I feel this could be well service service be very slow they seem to be a family run restaurant and sometimes which be more often than not when they be busy service can be very slow they have to very soon hire some more help hand if they continue to experience this much of demand ambiance simple and minimalist interior of a north eastern roadside joint price pretty decently price for the quality and taste that they offer it be really a steal deal', 'an extremely accessible joint situate on the main road with a pretty good variety of north east cuisine and a polite bunch of staff we plan to try anything but option in pork so we order pork belly with veggie n kimchi salad the particular dish be suppose to be consume be a unique fashion the pork belly veggie and kimchi be to be place on the lettuce leaf and wrap this combination be delicious and you would love it next we have smoke pork rib which I assume have barbecue sauce and sesame seed and taste pretty soft tender and yum the beef curry and steamed rice be decent but extremely spicy you can specify how spicy you want your dish and they can suggest or customise their dish

I have attach a picture of it for reference moreover the portion size be quite small in relation to the price of the dish a small bowl of beef curry be and one plate of steamed rice be not even enough

costly place and not much appreciate for student service be really very slow quantity be not much appreciated but kinda okay but not all dish they have less staff so do with the negative part and the positive thing be that you get to have pork there which be rare in this area and the food be not that great but kinda okay if you wanna try something new and also spend some extra buck then go for it

interior very calm and cozy place they also have banquet hall and a conference hall and they also undertake catering order for party and function and after the dastar be set we sit down for the food and they first bring the yakhni shorba shorba be nothing but the soup yakhni shorba be a dish from kashmir people in the north tend to have it more and it be a very good source of protein usually it be mild in spice level but at hyderabadi daawat owe to the spice craving of hyderabadi it be make a little spicy but the taste be fantastic it be the good way to start off your meal next come the starter in which we be serve the wok toss chicken phuket fish sikandari raan and murgh sholay kebab let s start with what we love the most the sikandari raan it s one whole leg from the goat or sheep you know for a fact that mutton and beef aren t usually as tender as chicken but the chef at hyderabadi daawat change this notion entirely the mutton from the raan be soo soft tender and juicy that your tooth have no work to do cause it just melt and talk about the spice it be very mild in spice and very well marinated come to the significance of the name sikandari raan most of you must be know that alexander the great who have capture almost all part of the world be know as sikandar e azam after win one of the battle in b c at takshila he take the ruler call porus as captive and when porus be ask what he want he tell he want they to treat he like a king and soo alexander or sikandar take he as his friend and arrange for a lavish buffet in which this raan be signature dish and since then it be name as sikandari raan well we think no other name would have justify the size and taste of this dish well than sikandari raan a must must have for you all highly recommend dish if you re here the next good starter be the phuket fish it s a nice spicy fish coat with finely chop onion ginger garlic paste and toss in soya and chilli sauce the taste be of another level next we have the wok toss chicken wok toss be an east asian style of cooking where they use wok or metal pan with shallow bowl use for fry or steam the taste of the chicken be really good with all rightly mixed flavour and spice but it be a bit hard to chew soo we recommend the chef to look into that and next come the murgh sholay kebab it be the barbeque style chicken very nicely marinated and tender to eat and the presentation be amazingly do after we be do with the starter they bring a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish call chelo kebab it be extremely well present chelo kebab be an iranian dish in which there be cook rice along with variety of chicken kebab the chicken and the rice as well be too mild in spice but rich in flavour after this the main course be start in which we be serve the chicken lababdar nihari gosht and murgh musallam with butter naan nihari gosht be love it wasn t like the usual nihari that you eat on a regular basis it be different and very thick and spicy and the mutton which they use be really tender do try this dish here chicken lababdar be really lababdar along with the butter naan it be a perfect combo murgh musallam be completely different here when compare to the murgh musallam we have at other place here they serve the murgh musallam with rice and the meat be fill with mince mutton and egg you should definitely try this dish we be do with all this but how can you even think that a hyderabadi daawat would end without the hyderabadi biryani we have the mutton biryani it be very rich in flavour and season with good amount of roasted onion the aroma of the ghee add to the taste of the biryani and the daawat come to an end with the dessert you commonly find in a hyderabadi daawat matka firni and double ka meetha double ka meetha be the very usual dish you see in the function of hyderabad it be make with roasted bread to which milk cinnamon and almond powder be add and at hyderabadi daawat it be perfectly make and be serve hot overall the

in not so spicy mixture it be delicious and it be a musttry on my list I jump ahead a lil without mention the soup because murgh kalmi be magical likewise yakhni shorba indianize mutton soup be a great way to get thing start it have the perfect balance of flavour and that subtle amount black pepper do a great job sabz ki shaami a mash vegetable mixture fry in oil serve with mayonnaise and mint chutney be a good light vegetarian starter paneer achari kebab wasn t the soft and also the side be burn a lil so they need to work on this otherwise the flavor be pretty good gosht sheekh kebab a classic the salt level be perfect and the meat be really tender feel it be a bit dry though patrani fish wrap inside a banana I m guess leaf be top with a layer of mint chutney although the fish be heavenly I d love it to be serve without the layering of the chutney tandoori jhinga be again beautifully do and it be the second musttry starter the drink get mixed reaction well of they be below average and another be extraordinary it be a rollercoaster in this dept we give the review to the management regard the basic one and soon after that they present we cinderella caramel mint mojito and mint cooler which just blow we all away I hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktail as well the main course have we die we be already so full and there be plenty of food leave gosht achari murgh achari the former be a lil more spicy be just classic dish be serve and when you combine they with nicely do butter naan there s nothing well than this combination nargisi kofta be another curry couldn t differentiate much when compare to the other two special mention go to sikendari raan for it be a treat to watch this magnificent char leg piece of a lamb on a plate with ooze juice and scrumptious side if you re a lamb lover then it be something that ll satisfy all your mutton craving food get a solid need to work on the drink though ambiance it be a huge property just opposite to sln terminus with ground and first floor seat it have plenty of space to fill in atleast people at once although the place be well light I didn t feel anything special be around because right now and always theme base restaurant will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well light place with good furniture hyderabadi daawat should incorporate anything and everything hyderabad have to offer in it s culture as nobody else in that area be do that I have crazy idea like make the waiter wear a classic lungi have marfa hyderabadi band baaja outside on the weekend but the classy interior just don t allow this to happen well you never know I m not say that place be bad but they have to add an element of joy ambiance get service it be decent as they re pretty fresh in the market they ll have to work rigorously to improvise accord to the customer taste the food arrive in an ample time and the table be be clear every now and then I d like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual name the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order the waiter butler need to push the special everyday rather than just leave it on the vast menu they have overall service get why hyderabadi daawat authentic will I specially go to hd sometimes', 'it s always good to see restaurant which focus on hyderabadi cuisine since it s so diverse and encompass a lot of different variety within it hyderabadi daawat do justice to it s name but treat we to good hyderabadi food the restaurant be locate on

meat be literally fall apart from the bone achari paneer season with pickle masala and be just cook to perfection sabz ki shami the texture feel a little strange to I tandoori aaloo soft and fluffy stuff potato with crispy grill skin on the exterior murgh kalmi kebab marinate chicken in mild spice grill to perfection in a tandoor gosht seekh kebab it be extremely easy to dry out a seekh kebab but they nail it here patrani fish and tandoori jhinga need a improvement as they lack depth of flavour and taste their main course comprise of murgh mussalam nargisi kofta achari murgh shahi paneer dal akbari gosht masala their sikandari raan and murgh mussalam deserve a special mention a variety of mocktail be available out of which my personal favourite happen to be the lemon mint cooler

begin the meal with a serving of a traditional yakhni shorba which be a flavour pump version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal with every sip the flavour become increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue then come an array of appetizer both for the veg as well as non veg from the vegetarian one I personally love the achaari paneer tikka which have soft piece of paneer marinate in a balanced pickle spice mix which have just the right amount of tanginess to it from the non vegetarian menu there be quite a few who make to my favourite include the murgh kalmi kebab chicken leg piece marinate heavy handedly in spice and finish in tandoor to perfection gosht seekh kebab plain old mutton kebab with juicy succulent mutton mince and patrani fish fish cover in a subtle coconut base marinade wrap in cabbage and finish in tandoor from among the specialty from the area the restaurant present we with their sikandari rann which be a whole leg of lamb marinate with whole spice like clove cinnamon pepper and cashew nut finish slowly in a tandoor and serve on a bed of fry onion and garlic with some mutton shami kebab on the side

bed of rice even after the rann the show wasn t over and we go in for main try out their gosht masala achari chicken and nargisi kofta all of which go really well with some hot stuff kulchas and flaky garlic naan nargisi kofta be my favourite one which have the same delicious mutton keema wrap around boil egg and toss in a rich spicy onion tomato gravy gosht masala be a tiny bit more spicy that the kofta and have flavourful bone in mutton piece with the achari chicken the restaurant again show excellence in term of balance of flavour as the dish wasn t too tangy as preparation in most of the other restaurant turn out to be gil e firdaus and fruit salad mark the end of our meal with a sweet note both of which be less of sugar and actually quite good the service here at hyderabadi dawaat be just as good as their food the staff be warm and corteous and take care of each and every need for we diner be it a glass of water or a change of plate I be highly impressed with the kitchen which
